# Introduction to Data Engineering

***Data Engineering*** is the design and development of systems for collecting, storing and analyzing data at scale.

## Architecture

During the course we will replicate the following architecture:

![architecture diagram](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/raw/main/images/architecture/arch_1.jpg)

* [New York's Taxi and Limousine Corporation's Trip Records Dataset](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/dataset.md): the dataset we will use during the course.
* [Spark](https://spark.apache.org/): analytics engine for large-scale data processing (distributed processing).
* [Google BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/products/bigquery/): serverless _data warehouse_ (central repository of integrated data from one or more disparate sources).
* [Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/): workflow management platform for data engineering pipelines. In other words, a pipeline orchestration tool.
* [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/): unified, high-throughput,low-latency platform for handling real-time data feeds (streaming).

## Data pipelines

A **data pipeline** is a service that receives data as input and outputs more data. For example, reading a CSV file, transforming the data somehow and storing it as a table in a PostgreSQL database.

# Docker and Postgres

## Docker basic concepts

_([Video source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYNwNlOrpr0&list=PL3MmuxUbc_hJed7dXYoJw8DoCuVHhGEQb&index=3))_

**Docker** is a _containerization software_ that allows us to isolate software in a similar way to virtual machines but in a much leaner way.

A **Docker image** is a _snapshot_ of a container that we can define to run our software, or in this case our data pipelines. By exporting our Docker images to Cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services or Google Cloud Platform we can run our containers there.

Docker provides the following advantages:
* Reproducibility
* Local experimentation
* Integration tests (CI/CD)
* Running pipelines on the cloud (AWS Batch, Kubernetes jobs)
* Spark (analytics engine for large-scale data processing)
* Serverless (AWS Lambda, Google functions)

Docker containers are ***stateless***: any changes done inside a container will **NOT** be saved when the container is killed and started again. This is an advantage because it allows us to restore any container to its initial state in a reproducible manner, but you will have to store data elsewhere if you need to do so; a common way to do so is with _volumes_.

>Note: you can learn more about Docker and how to set it up on a Mac [in this link](https://github.com/ziritrion/ml-zoomcamp/blob/11_kserve/notes/05b_virtenvs.md#docker). You may also be interested in a [Docker reference cheatsheet](https://gist.github.com/ziritrion/1842c8a4c4851602a8733bba19ab6050#docker).

## Creating a custom pipeline with Docker

_([Video source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYNwNlOrpr0&list=PL3MmuxUbc_hJed7dXYoJw8DoCuVHhGEQb&index=3))_

Let's create an example pipeline. We will create a dummy `pipeline.py` Python script that receives an argument and prints it.

```python
import sys
import pandas # we don't need this but it's useful for the example

# print arguments
print(sys.argv)

# argument 0 is the name os the file
# argumment 1 contains the actual first argument we care about
day = sys.argv[1]

# cool pandas stuff goes here

# print a sentence with the argument
print(f'job finished successfully for day = {day}')
```

We can run this script with `python pipeline.py <some_number>` and it should print 2 lines:
* `['pipeline.py', '<some_number>']`
* `job finished successfully for day = <some_number>`

Let's containerize it by creating a Docker image. Create the folllowing `Dockerfile` file:

```dockerfile
# base Docker image that we will build on
FROM python:3.9.1

# set up our image by installing prerequisites; pandas in this case
RUN pip install pandas

# set up the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app
# copy the script to the container. 1st name is source file, 2nd is destination
COPY pipeline.py pipeline.py

# define what to do first when the container runs
# in this example, we will just run the script
ENTRYPOINT ["python", "pipeline.py"]
```

Let's build the image:


```ssh
docker build -t test:pandas .
```
* The image name will be `test` and its tag will be `pandas`. If the tag isn't specified it will default to `latest`.

We can now run the container and pass an argument to it, so that our pipeline will receive it:

```ssh
docker run -it test:pandas some_number
```

You should get the same output you did when you ran the pipeline script by itself.

>Note: these instructions asume that `pipeline.py` and `Dockerfile` are in the same directory. The Docker commands should also be run from the same directory as these files.

## Running Postgres in a container

_([Video source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JM-ziJt0WI&list=PL3MmuxUbc_hJed7dXYoJw8DoCuVHhGEQb&index=4))_

In later parts of the course we will use Airflow, which uses PostgreSQL internally. For simpler tests we can use PostgreSQL (or just Postgres) directly.

You can run a containerized version of Postgres that doesn't require any installation steps. You only need to provide a few _environment variables_ to it as well as a _volume_ for storing data.

Create a folder anywhere you'd like for Postgres to store data in. We will use the example folder `ny_taxi_postgres_data`. Here's how to run the container:

```bash
docker run -it \
    -e POSTGRES_USER="root" \
    -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD="root" \
    -e POSTGRES_DB="ny_taxi" \
    -v $(pwd)/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data \
    -p 5432:5432 \
    postgres:13
```
* The container needs 3 environment variables:
    * `POSTGRES_USER` is the username for logging into the database. We chose `root`.
    * `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` is the password for the database. We chose `root`
        * ***IMPORTANT: These values are only meant for testing. Please change them for any serious project.***
    * `POSTGRES_DB` is the name that we will give the database. We chose `ny_taxi`.
* `-v` points to the volume directory. The colon `:` separates the first part (path to the folder in the host computer) from the second part (path to the folder inside the container).
    * Path names must be absolute. If you're in a UNIX-like system, you can use `pwd` to print you local folder as a shortcut; this example should work with both `bash` and `zsh` shells, but `fish` will require you to remove the `$`.
    * This command will only work if you run it from a directory which contains the `ny_taxi_postgres_data` subdirectory you created above.
* The `-p` is for port mapping. We map the default Postgres port to the same port in the host.
* The last argument is the image name and tag. We run the official `postgres` image on its version `13`.

Once the container is running, we can log into our database with [pgcli](https://www.pgcli.com/) with the following command:

```bash
pgcli -h localhost -p 5432 -u root -d ny_taxi
```
* `-h` is the host. Since we're running locally we can use `localhost`.
* `-p` is the port.
* `-u` is the username.
* `-d` is the database name.
* The password is not provided; it will be requested after running the command.

## Inserting data to Postgres with Python

_([Video source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JM-ziJt0WI&list=PL3MmuxUbc_hJed7dXYoJw8DoCuVHhGEQb&index=4))_

We will now create a Jupyter Notebook `upload-data.ipynb` file which we will use to read a CSV file and export it to Postgres.

We will use data from the [NYC TLC Trip Record Data website](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page). Specifically, we will use the [Yellow taxi trip records CSV file for January 2021](https://s3.amazonaws.com/nyc-tlc/trip+data/yellow_tripdata_2021-01.csv). A dictionary to understand each field is available [here](https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/tlc/downloads/pdf/data_dictionary_trip_records_yellow.pdf).

>Note: knowledge of Jupyter Notebook, Python environment management and Pandas is asumed in these notes. Please check [this link](https://gist.github.com/ziritrion/9b80e47956adc0f20ecce209d494cd0a#pandas) for a Pandas cheatsheet and [this link](https://gist.github.com/ziritrion/8024025672ea92b8bdeb320d6015aa0d) for a Conda cheatsheet for Python environment management.

Check the completed `upload-data.ipynb` [in this link](../1_intro/upload-data.ipynb) for a detailed guide. Feel free to copy the file to your work directory; in the same directory you will need to have the CSV file linked above and the `ny_taxi_postgres_data` subdirectory.

## Running pgAdmin and Docker networking

_([Video source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCAIVe9N0ow&list=PL3MmuxUbc_hJed7dXYoJw8DoCuVHhGEQb&index=5))_

`pgcli` is a handy tool but it's cumbersome to use. [`pgAdmin` is a web-based tool](https://www.pgadmin.org/) that makes it more convenient to access and manage our databases. It's possible to run pgAdmin as as container along with the Postgres container, but both containers will have to be in the same _virtual network_ so that they can find each other.

Let's create a virtual Docker network called `pg-network`:

```bash
docker network create pg-network
```

We will now re-run our Postgres container with the added network name and the container network name, so that the pgAdmin container can find it (we'll use `pg-database` for the container name):

```bash
docker run -it \
    -e POSTGRES_USER="root" \
    -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD="root" \
    -e POSTGRES_DB="ny_taxi" \
    -v $(pwd)/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data \
    -p 5432:5432 \
    --network=pg-network \
    --name pg-database \
    postgres:13
```

We will now run the pgAdmin container on another terminal:

```bash
docker run -it \
    -e PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL="admin@admin.com" \
    -e PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD="root" \
    -p 8080:80 \
    --network=pg-network \
    --name pgadmin \
    dpage/pgadmin4
```
* The container needs 2 environment variables: a login email and a password. We use `admin@admin.com` and `root` in this example.
 * ***IMPORTANT: these are example values for testing and should never be used on production. Change them accordingly when needed.***
* pgAdmin is a web app and its default port is 80; we map it to 8080 in our localhost to avoid any possible conflicts.
* Just like with the Postgres container, we specify a network and a name. However, the name in this example isn't really necessary because there won't be any containers trying to access this particular container.
* The actual image name is `dpage/pgadmin4` .

You should now be able to load pgAdmin on a web browser by browsing to `localhost:8080`. Use the same email and password you used for running the container to log in.

Right-click on _Servers_ on the left sidebar and select _Create_ > _Server..._

![steps](images/01_02.png)

Under _General_ give the Server a name and under _Connection_ add the same host name, user and password you used when running the container.

![steps](images/01_03.png)
![steps](images/01_04.png)

Click on _Save_. You should now be connected to the database.

We will explore using pgAdmin in later lessons.


## Using the ingestion script with Docker

_([Video source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1WwATwf-vY&list=PL3MmuxUbc_hJed7dXYoJw8DoCuVHhGEQb&index=8))_

We will now export the Jupyter notebook file to a regular Python script and use Docker to run it.

### Exporting and testing the script

You can export the `ipynb` file to `py` with this command:

```bash
jupyter nbconvert --to=script upload-data.ipynb
```

Clean up the script by removing everything we don't need. We will also rename it to `ingest_data.py` and add a few modifications:
* We will use [argparse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html) to handle the following command line arguments:
    * Username
    * Password
    * Host
    * Port
    * Database name
    * Table name
    * URL for the CSV file
* The _engine_ we created for connecting to Postgres will be tweaked so that we pass the parameters and build the URL from them, like this:
    ```python
    engine = create_engine(f'postgresql://{user}:{password}@{host}:{port}/{db}')
    ```
* We will also download the CSV using the provided URL argument.

You can check the completed `ingest_data.py` script [in this link](../1_intro/ingest_data.py).

In order to test the script we will have to drop the table we previously created. In pgAdmin, in the sidebar navigate to _Servers > Docker localhost > Databases > ny_taxi > Schemas > public > Tables > yellow_taxi_data_, right click on _yellow_taxi_data_ and select _Query tool_. Introduce the following command:

```sql
DROP TABLE yellow_taxi_data;
```

We are now ready to test the script with the following command:

```bash
python ingest_data.py \
    --user=root \
    --password=root \
    --host=localhost \
    --port=5432 \
    --db=ny_taxi \
    --table_name=yellow_taxi_trips \
    --url="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nyc-tlc/trip+data/yellow_tripdata_2021-01.csv"
```
* Note that we've changed the table name from `yellow_taxi_data` to `yellow_taxi_trips`.

Back in pgAdmin, refresh the Tables and check that `yellow_taxi_trips` was created. You can also run a SQL query to check the contents:

```sql
SELECT
    COUNT(1)
FROM
    yellow_taxi_trips;
```
* This query should return 1,369,765 rows.

### Dockerizing the script

Let's modify the [Dockerfile we created before](#creating-a-custom-pipeline-with-docker) to include our `ingest_data.py` script and create a new image:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9.1

RUN apt-get install wget
# psycopg2 is a postgres db adapter for python: sqlalchemy needs it
RUN pip install pandas sqlalchemy psycopg2

WORKDIR /app
COPY ingest_data.py ingest_data.py 

ENTRYPOINT [ "python", "ingest_data.py" ]
```

Build the image:
```bash
docker build -t taxi_ingest:v001 .
```

And run it:
```bash
docker run -it \
    --network=pg-network \
    taxi_ingest:v001 \
    --user=root \
    --password=root \
    --host=pg-database \
    --port=5432 \
    --db=ny_taxi \
    --table_name=yellow_taxi_trips \
    --url="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nyc-tlc/trip+data/yellow_tripdata_2021-01.csv"
```
* We need to provide the network for Docker to find the Postgres container. It goes before the name of the image.
* Since Postgres is running on a separate container, the host argument will have to point to the container name of Postgres.
* You can drop the table in pgAdmin beforehand if you want, but the script will automatically replace the pre-existing table.

# Terraform and Google Cloud Platform


_([Video source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hajwnmj0xfQ&list=PL3MmuxUbc_hJed7dXYoJw8DoCuVHhGEQb&index=6))_

[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) is an [infrastructure as code](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Infrastructure_as_code) tool that allows us to provision infrastructure resources as code, thus making it possible to handle infrastructure as an additional software component and take advantage of tools such as version control. It also allows us to bypass the cloud vendor GUIs.

During this course we will use [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/) (GCP) as our cloud services provider.

## GCP initial setup

_([Video source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hajwnmj0xfQ&list=PL3MmuxUbc_hJed7dXYoJw8DoCuVHhGEQb&index=6))_

GCP is organized around _projects_. You may create a project and access all available GCP resources and services from the project dashboard.

We will now create a project and a _service account_, and we will download the authentication keys to our computer. A _service account_ is like a user account but for apps and workloads; you may authorize or limit what resources are available to your apps with service accounts.

>You can jump to the [next section](1_intro.md#gcp-setup-for-access) if you already know how to do this.

Please follow these steps:

1. Create an account on GCP. You should receive $300 in credit when signing up on GCP for the first time with an account.
1. Setup a new project and write down the Project ID.
    1. From the GCP Dashboard, click on the drop down menu next to the _Google Cloud Platform_ title to show the project list and click on _New project_.
    1. Give the project a name. We will use `dtc-de` in this example. You can use the autogenerated Project ID (this ID must be unique to all of GCP, not just your account). Leave the organization as _No organization_. Click on _Create_.
    1. Back on the dashboard, make sure that your project is selected. Click on the previous drop down menu to select it otherwise.
1. Setup a service account for this project and download the JSON authentication key files.
    1. _IAM & Admin_ > _Service accounts_ > _Create service account_
    1. Provide a service account name. We will use `dtc-de-user`. Leave all other fields with the default values. Click on _Create and continue_.
    1. Grant the Viewer role (_Basic_ > _Viewer_) to the service account and click on _Continue_
    1. There is no need to grant users access to this service account at the moment. Click on _Done_.
    1. With the service account created, click on the 3 dots below _Actions_ and select _Manage keys_.
    1. _Add key_ > _Create new key_. Select _JSON_ and click _Create_. The files will be downloaded to your computer. Save them to a folder and write down the path.
1. Download the [GCP SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/quickstart) for local setup. Follow the instructions to install and connect to your account and project.
1. Set the environment variable to point to the auth keys.
    1. The environment variable name is `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`
    1. The value for the variable is the path to the json authentication file you downloaded previously.
    1. Check how to assign environment variables in your system and shell. In bash, the command should be:
        ```bash
        export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="<path/to/authkeys>.json"
        ```
    1. Refresh the token and verify the authentication with the GCP SDK:
        ```bash
        gcloud auth application-default login
        ```

You should now be ready to work with GCP.

## GCP setup for access

_([Video source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hajwnmj0xfQ&list=PL3MmuxUbc_hJed7dXYoJw8DoCuVHhGEQb&index=6))_

In the following chapters we will setup a _Data Lake_ on Google Cloud Storage and a _Data Warehouse_ in BigQuery. We will explore these concepts in future lessons but a Data Lake is where we would usually store data and a Data Warehouse provides a more structured way to access this data.

We need to setup access first:

1. Assign the following IAM Roles to the Service Account: Storage Admin, Storage Object Admin, BigQuery Admin, Viewer
    1. On the GCP Project dashboard, go to _IAM & Admin_ > _IAM_
    1. Select the previously created Service Account and edit the permissions by clicking on the pencil shaped icon on the left.
    1. Add the following roles and click on _Save_ afterwards:
        * `Storage Admin`: for creating and managing _buckets_.
        * `Storage Object Admin`: for creating and managing _objects_ within the buckets.
        * `BigQuery Admin`: for managing BigQuery resources and data.
        * `Viewer` should already be present as a role.
1. Enable APIs for the project (these are needed so that Terraform can interact with GCP):
   * https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/iam.googleapis.com
   * https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/iamcredentials.googleapis.com
1. Make sure that the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable is set.
